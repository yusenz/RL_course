This git repo hosts the material for lab modules and (potentially) project related files for the reinforcement learning course at Emory BMI fall 2024. 
The docker image is used as a jupyter server for jupyter notebooks. Alternatively, you can mount your own scripts into the container and run them from the terminal. 
Figuring out environment on your own is also viable by following the steps in the Dockerfile on your local machine - you do need to go through pytorch installation instead of convieniently using the docker image provided as the base image here.
